# Automatic-irrigation-system


  ### Introduction
  
Watering plants can be time-consuming and sometimes wasteful. An Automatic Irrigation System solves this problem by watering plants only when they need it. This project uses an Arduino to read data from a soil 
moisture sensor and control a water pump automatically.To make it more interactive, the system includes LEDs to show the status (e.g., dry, watering, or wet), buttons for manual controls, and an LCD to display real-time information like soil moisture levels and system status. This simple yet smart system saves water, helps plants stay healthy, and makes gardening easier and more efficient!
