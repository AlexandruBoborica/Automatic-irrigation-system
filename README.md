# Automatic-irrigation-system

  ### Introduction
  
Watering plants can be time-consuming and sometimes wasteful. An Automatic Irrigation System solves this problem by watering plants only when they need it. This project uses an Arduino to read data from a soil 
moisture sensor and control a water pump automatically.To make it more interactive, the system includes LEDs to show the status (e.g., dry, watering, or wet), buttons for manual controls, and an LCD to display real-time information like soil moisture levels and system status. This simple yet smart system saves water, helps plants stay healthy, and makes gardening easier and more efficient! 
     
  ### General description
The purpose of this project is the maintenance of a plant or a garden or even a crop, if we were to expand the project, using the arduino-uno microcontroller and its various peripherals.A sensor collects data from the ground, data based on which the microcontroller sends commands through a relay that activates a submersible pump. Through a hose, it pumps water to the ground until the sensor reads a certain level of humidity. This process is automatic but also manual by pressing a button and signaled by the presence of an LCD and an RGB LED.
